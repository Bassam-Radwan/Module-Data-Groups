// Predict and explain first...

// This program attempts to log out all the property values in the object.
// But it isn't working. Explain why first and then fix the problem

const author = {
  firstName: "Zadie",
  lastName: "Smith",
  occupation: "writer",
  age: 40,
  alive: true,
};

for (const value in author) {
  console.log(author[value]);
}

// The for of loop does nt work with objects without giving  Object.values(), we can add this method to the loop or we can use for in loop which accesses to each value in the object.
